In this project, I was tasked with working on code written by another programmer. My assignment was to create a slideshow (gallery) that would be triggered by clicking on a selected photo (a <figure> element containing an <img> element). The client already had HTML, CSS, and JS code in place. I was asked to not modify the HTML and CSS, and to maintain the existing conventions in the JavaScript.

The aim of this project was to find yourself in someone else's code and perform the assigned task.
